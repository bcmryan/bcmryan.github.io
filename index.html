        My name is Brendan Ryan, and I am a Masters of Arts student in <a href="http://paul.igl.uni-freiburg.de/MEL/en/" target="_blank">European Linguistics</a> at <a href="http://www.uni-freiburg.de" target="_blank">Albert-Ludwigs-Universit&auml;t Freiburg</a> in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany with an expected graduate date of summer semester 2017. My studies and personal interests focus on the ever-changing social, political and linguistic landscape of Europe.<br>
    <br>I began my studies in Freiburg in winter semester 2015 after graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Madison earlier that year with a Bachelor of Arts with Distinction in German and Linguistics alongside Honors in the Liberal Arts and a certificate in European Studies.<br>
    <br>Throughout my studies, I have obtained varying levels of fluency in numerous languages. These include (ranked by level): advanced: German and Turkish; intermediate: French, Spanish and Portuguese; elementary: American Sign Language and Yucatec Maya.<br>
    <br>In tandem with learning languages, I have also been involved in numerous research projects focusing on, among other topics, the linguistic analysis of the Kiezdeutsch sociolect of German, the American Indian language Menominee and the Oita-ben dialect of Japanese, as well as linguistics descriptions of Ukrainian and Yoruba. Additionally, I have taken courses focusing on Germanic, Slavic and many other languages and language families.<br>
    <br>Alongside my graduate studies, I am currently employed as a research assistant at Albert-Ludwigs-Universit&auml;t Freiburg's <a href="http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp" target="_blank">German Research Foundation</a>-funded <a href="http://www.sfb948.uni-freiburg.de" target="_blank">Collaborative Research Centre 948</a> as a German-English translator and English copy-editor.</p>
    In addition to my university studies in Freiburg and Madison, I have also had extensive practical experience on both sides of the Atlantic needed to successfully persue a career in international relations, diplomacy and linguistics.<br>
    <br>Beyond structured and independent study courses, I have been able to develop skills needed for a professional, international and public service-oriented working atmosphere as an AmeriCorps member and Community Outreach Coordinator with <a href="http://energyservicecorps.org/wisconsin" target="_blank">WISPIRG Energy Service Corps</a> (summer 2012), an intern with the U.S. Department of State at the <a href="https://de.usembassy.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Embassy-Berlin</a> (spring 2013) and <a href="https://www.studyabroad.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">International Academic Programs</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2014-15), as an active alumnus (2013-14) and staff (2015-present) of the <a href="http://www.ayf.uni-freiburg.de/" target="_blank">Academic Year in Freiburg</a> program and as a <a href="https://www.studieninfo-bw.de/entscheiden/studienbotschafter/" target="_blank">Study Ambassador</a> for Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg's State Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts (2015-present).<br>
    <br>Additionally, I have been an active participant in political events in Germany and the United States and have striven to give back to my host country as an English tutor for under-priviledged children (2013-14) and teacher working with immigrants to Germany (2015-16).
