						<p>If you have been following along, you should now be able to access any directory or file via Samba on pretty much any computer or smart device connected through your local network.
That is pretty neat.
If that is enough for you and your needs, you can stop right here, but if you start exploring the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization">containerization</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a>, continue along.</p>
<p>In short, containerization allows you to run a computer system within a larger operating system.
It differs from full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization">virtualization</a> in that what is being run is a very bare-bones system and not a full operating system.
You can think about full operating system virtualization as running a full copy of Ubuntu inside of an install of Ubuntu.
You can use your mouse and keyboard within the operating system and even install applications, but once you close the program that is a running the virtual machine, you can no longer access the data or applications saved in it.
Containerization, on the other hand, is more like running a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxed</a> application within an operating system.
It may not be as versitile as running a full operating system, but it does have a few advantages: not only is a containerized application, like an application installed on a virtual machine, only able to access the data, conncted devices, etc. on the host that you allow it to, but it also uses a lot fewer resources than a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Imagine that you want to run an application for online banking.
You could install it on your desktop and use it there.
You may though want to add a layer of security (you would not want a potential virus to gain access to your application data, for instance), so you could install a virtual machine inside of your desktop and only use the virtual machine for that single purpose.
Conversely, you could install a containerized version of the application on your desktop and deny access to data generated by that application to any other application.
Security might be a reason to not install that application directly on your desktop, but the install size and maintainability of the application may be the reason to containerize it and not virtualize it: a modern Windows install can take the better part of a day and dozens of gigabytes in space, while the installation of a Docker image can take as little as a few minutes.
Another added benefit to containzerization over a local installation of an application when security is not as important (as with an install of Jellyfin on a Raspberry Pi server, for example) is that the application data are not scattered all around your system.
If you need to reinstall your base operating system, you can just copy over your configuration and data directory and replace it once you are done.
It is really that easy.
For the reasons of security and portability, containerization was chosen for the Reproducible Pi server build.</p>
<p>For installing Docker, again following <a href="https://blog.linuxserver.io/2017/06/24/the-perfect-media-server-2017/">The Perfect Media Server 2017</a> build guide and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYI32kx4hPE">accompanying YouTube video</a>, you will use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script">convience install script</a>.
Note that the following command will run a <a href="https://get.docker.com/">script</a> (piped through to the shell) downloaded using <code>curl</code> directly from the internet.
This is generally to be avoided for security reasons, so you should look over it before completing this next step.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ curl https://get.docker.com | sh</code></p>
<p>Once you are returned to an empty command line, grant user pi access to the newly created group named docker with <code>usermod</code>.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo usermod --append --groups docker pi</code></p>
<p>You can confirm that user pi is now part of group docker by running the <code>id</code> followed by the username to see the user&rsquo;s group memberships.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ id pi</code></p>
<p>With <code>sudo</code> privileges (following a post-install reboot, this will no longer be necessary), you can test your Docker install by running (<code>run</code>) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program"><code>hello-world</code></a> command.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo docker run hello-world</code></p>
<p>With this test you can see that Docker was unable to find an included image for <code>hello-world</code> and thus downloaded (pulled) one from its online repository.</p>
<h3 id="docker-compose">Docker Compose</h3>
<p>Now with Docker installed, you are going to install a <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose">Docker Compose image from LinuxServer.io</a>.
Docker Compose is a tool for defining how Docker images should run through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> config file.
While setting up and running Docker images is possible without Docker Compose, Docker Compose allows you to save all configuration information for multiple images in a single text file.
This gives you flexibility when migrating your configurations and makes sure that images are run with the same parameters every time (something that is much harder if you need to manually type in your entire command each time you need to restart a service (for instance, after a power outage or following rutine maintence).</p>
<p>To install Docker Compose, you will again need to run a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-docker-compose/master/run.sh">script</a> downloaded from the internet via <code>curl</code> (with <code>--location</code> and <code>--output</code> defining that the file will be saved and the location where it will be saved), so you should again glance over it before proceeding.
Note that running this command saves the script in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, so it will now be accessible like any other command line program installed on your server.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo curl --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-docker-compose/master/run.sh --output /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code></p>
<p>In order use Docker Compose, make the file executable (able to be run as a command line program) using the <code>chmod</code> command with option <code>+x</code> and elevated privileges.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code></p>
<p>To confirm that Docker and Docker Compose have installed correctly, check the version of each program.
First, confirm that docker is running with elevated privileges (again, after a reboot, <code>sudo</code> will no longer be necessary for either program).</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo docker version</code></p>
<p>Now, check the version of Docker Compose.
As this is the first use of Docker Compose, the newest image will be downloaded and installed.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo docker-compose version</code></p>
<p>In order to update both Docker and Docker Compose, you will just need to download and install the latest version as a script or Docker image, respectively.
For Docker, you simply rerun the script installed earlier (which is again downloaded and then immediately run on the Raspberry Pi).
As Docker has only been installed with this script in the past, you can safely ignore any warnings during installation.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ curl https://get.docker.com | sh</code></p>
<p>For Docker Compose, on the other hand, you need to first <code>pull</code> the latest image (which is automatically matched to your hardware architecture) and then <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_prune/"><code>prune</code></a> any remaining dangling (one neither tagged nor referenced by a container) images, with the option <code>--force</code> meaning that you are not asked for confirmation.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo docker pull linuxserver/docker-compose:&quot;${DOCKER_COMPOSE_IMAGE_TAG:-latest}&quot; &amp;&amp; sudo docker image prune --force</code></p>
<p>The default location for <code>docker-compose.yml</code> is in the <code>/home</code> directory of the user.
I perfer creating a completely separate directory which houses all Docker-related files in the <code>/</code> (root) directory of the file system.
(Note that this has worked well for me, but it is not a guarentee that going against the default may not cause issues later.)
In order to do this, use the <code>mkdir</code> command with the option <code>--parents</code> to create the directory <code>/docker/docker-compose</code> and its parent <code>/docker</code> with elevated privileges.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo mkdir --parents /docker/docker-compose</code></p>
<h3 id="jellyfin">Jellyfin</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfin">Jellyfin</a> is a media server that allows you to access your media through a browser or native applications on different devices on your local network through a GUI.
To exemplify how Docker Compose can be used on your Raspberry Pi server, you will install Jellyfin and interact with it using your media saved on <code>/mnt/storage</code>.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo mkdir /docker/jellyfin &amp;&amp; chown --recursive storagero:storage /docker/jellyfin</code></p>
<p>The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/jellyfin">Docker Compose example from LinuxServer.io</a> serves as the basis for this install (although I have provided edits and comments applicable to this install).
You will see that Jellyfin is being run by user storagero and thus does not have read-write access to <code>/mnt/storage</code> to avoid potential issues.
This of course though means that metadata will not be able to be exported as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.nfo">NFO</a> files, so I can not easily move it to another service (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_(software)">Kodi</a>).
Thus I do not edit any media metadata within Jellyfin and instead have created the correct file system structure and NFO files using <a href="https://www.tinymediamanager.org/">tinyMediaManager</a>.
(There are of course <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/jellyfin/comments/gdhyzg/to_nfo_or_not_to_nfo/">other opinions</a> regarding the use of NFO files and read-write access for Jellyfin.)
If I need to add or edit data saved on <code>/mnt/storage</code>, I do so over Samba from my desktop and rescan my library from within Jellyfin in order to apply the changes.
Note that the default timezone for this image is Europe/London; change this according to your local timezone.
The line beginning with <code>JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=</code> should be followed by the static IP address of the Raspberry Pi.
Under <code>volumes</code> and <code>devices</code> the path before the colon represents the path on your server, while the path after the colon is how this path is represented within Jellyfin when selecting directory locations.
These are in accordance with the naming scheme I have used for media within <code>/mnt/storage</code>, so you may need to edit these according to your needs.
As this is only instance of Jellyfin will only be used on my local network, I have commented out (thus deactivated) the lines in <code>ports</code> defining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> (i.e. encrypted network traffic) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> (i.e. device discovery) usage, while I have left port 8096 available to access Jellyfin (thus, the address to access Jellyfin will be 192.168.0.100:8096).
Finally, all <code>devices</code> are left activated so that Jellyfin will be able to take advantage of hardware acceleration for transcoding on the Raspberry Pi.
Copy the contents of this file using <code>tee</code> to <code>/docker/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code>.</p>

END
</code></pre><p>As these <code>/docker/docker-compose/</code> and <code>/docker/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> were created with <code>sudo</code> privileges, they are owned by <code>root</code>.
Using the <code>chown</code> command with the <code>--recursive</code> option and elevated privileges, give ownership of this directory to user pi and group pi, as this is the user which will be executing the start of Docker Compose.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo chown --recursive pi:pi /docker/docker-compose</code></p>
<p>Note that a Docker Compose file can hold instructions for running multiple containers.
To do this simply append the parameters to this file, making sure that the name is given so that it lines up with <code>jellyfin:</code> under <code>services:</code>.
Docker Compose was created to be the single config file for all Docker images, thus making your backups much more managable and simplifying your entire server.</p>
<p>You now need to create the directory <code>/docker/jellyfin/config</code> using <code>mkdir --parents</code> with elevated privileges as referenced in <code>/docker/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code>.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo mkdir --parents /docker/jellyfin/config</code></p>
<p>Given that Jellyfin is being run as user storagero and group storage, make this the owner of <code>/docker/jellyfin</code> with <code>chown --recursive</code>.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo chown --recursive storagero:storage /docker/jellyfin</code></p>
<p>Due to an <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/faq#libseccomp">issue with running LinuxServer.io images on operating systems based on 32-bit Debian due to a bug in libseccomp2</a>, you have to enable the backports repository for Debian Buster.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 04EE7237B7D453EC 648ACFD622F3D138</code>
<code>pi@repi:~$ echo &quot;deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main&quot; | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster-backports.list</code>
<code>pi@repi:~$ sudo apt update --yes</code>
<code>pi@repi:~$ sudo apt install --target-release buster-backports libseccomp2</code></p>
<p>Jellyfin also recommends setting <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html#raspberry-pi-3-and-4">graphical processing unit (GPU) memory allocation to 320 MB</a> as described in the Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/memory.md">official documentation</a>.</p>
<pre><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo tee /boot/config.txt &lt;&lt; END

# GPU memory allocation for Jellyfin
gpu_mem=320
END
</code></pre><p>Before continuing, you should now <code>update</code>, <code>full-upgrade</code> and <code>reboot</code> your system to make sure that everything to this point has been installed and configured correctly and to avoid potential problems with running Docker without elevated privileges.
Note that a reboot will close your SSH connection.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo apt update --yes &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade --yes &amp;&amp; sudo reboot</code></p>
<p>Wait about a minute, and then try to reestablish the SSH connection.
If it fails due to it timing out (i.e. taking too long to connect), wait a few seconds, and try again.</p>
<p><code>bcmryan@desktop:~$ ssh pi@192.168.0.100</code></p>
<p>With your fully up-to-date system, you are now ready to run Jellyfin via Docker Compose.
Due to a <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3875#issuecomment-502899871">quirk</a> in the way that Docker Compose works, it must always be started from a relative (and not absolute) path.
Thus, you first need to change into the <code>/docker</code> directory with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)"><code>cd</code></a> before you can start the Docker container.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ cd /docker</code></p>
<p>To run Docker Compose with the newly created config file, use the <code>docker-compose</code> command with the option <code>--file</code> for defining the file location and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/"><code>up --detach</code></a> to run the containers in the background.
Running this will download and install the latest Jellyfin image and begin its operation in the background.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:/docker $ docker-compose --file ./docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up --detach</code></p>
<p>From here, simply enter the IP address followed by the port number (i.e. 192.168.0.100:8096) into any web browser to complete the installation of Jellyfin.
As this is subject to change, I will not document the exact installation steps here, but I will mention the following:
I have enabled an administrator (default name is abc) and separate user accounts, with only the administrator having a password and <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/users/adding-managing-users.html#additional-options">being hidden from the login page</a>.
The path names are those given in the Docker Compose config file (i.e. <code>/mnt/storage/Movies</code> is accessed via <code>/data/movies</code>, and <code>/mnt/storage/Series</code> is accessed via <code>/data/tvshows</code>).
I have left unchecked all data scrappers throughout, as I do not want Jellyfin to edit my data.
Finally, you should be able to enable OpenMax hardware acceleration as described in Jellyfin&rsquo;s <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html#enabling-hardware-acceleration">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>When you finally get around to scanning your media files, note that it can take a very long time (up to a day if you have dozens of television shows with thousands of episodes).
Be patient (and check the administrator dashboard to see how far along you are).</p>
<p>And that is all.
Enjoy your media!</p>
