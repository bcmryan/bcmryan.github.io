						<p>So there you have it.
Welcome to your fully functional file and media server.</p>
<p>Let us review what you did in this tutorial.
First, you downloaded Raspberry Pi OS and flashed it to a microSD card.
From your desktop, you then set up SSH and gave yourself permanent access to the terminal emulator of the Raspberry Pi with an SSH key.
Additionally, you set static IP addresses on both your desktop and Raspberry Pi so that you do have to fumble around with dynamically allocated addresses.
For this same reason, you also set the Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s hostname.
Next, in order to control access to your files, you created different users with different permissions.
With mergerfs, you then merged externally attached hard drives into a single directory.
This single directory was then shared across the network via Samba, with all devices on the local network given read-only access and a single device given read-write access.
Using Docker and Docker Compose a containerized version of the Jellyfin media server was created with read-only access to the merged directory so as to prevent data loss.
Using <code>apt</code>, <code>cron</code> and custom scripts, you can now keep your system up to date and your backups secured.</p>
<p>Wow, that is a pretty impressive system, and it is just as amazing that it was built with readily available hardware and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open-source</a> software.
Remebering that this project was about creating a modular and reproducible server, I have a challenge for you: break it.
You read that correctly.
Rip out a hard drive; delete a couple packages; try to destroy your Jellyfin Docker container, or just delete your entire Docker Compose config file.
The point of this project is not only to create a file and media server but also to help you understand that modularity and reproducibility are your friends.
You should not be afraid of your system, and you should not be left out in the dark when you inevitably need to restore from a backup or need to just completely wipe a machine.
So, build your machine (and your network) with the knowledge that when (not if) the worst happens, you are prepared.</p>
<p>Personally, I am not finished with this project.
My next step is create a script that you can run directly from your desktop that will allow you to define your SSH key, static IP address, hostname, etc. before you even power on your Raspberry Pi for the first time.
A following script should then install all necessary packages, set up user accounts, etc. directly when executed directly from your Raspberry Pi.
My hope is that the knowledge you have gained from completing a build command by command will empower you to be able to use these scripts to restore your Raspberry Pi server following a catostrophic (or even not-so-catostrophic such as a major version upgrade) failure.</p>

I wish you all the best of luck.</p>
<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<p>I hope that this guide was thorough enough, but if you still have any other questions, take a look at this list of frequently asked questions below!</p>
<h3 id="what-can-i-do-if-i-do-not-have-access-to-a-linux-desktop">What can I do if I do not have access to a Linux desktop?</h3>
<p>The commands that are given throughout this guide are based on Linux. While I am nearly certain that they should also work on macOS via the Terminal app, I have not tested them.
On Windows, you can try Windows Subsystem for Linux and/or PowerShell, but I cannot guarentee compatibility.
I strongly urge you to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows">create a Linux live USB stick</a> so you can follow along as intended.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-get-even-bleeding-edge-firmware-and-kernel-updates">How can I get even bleeding-edge firmware and kernel updates?</h3>
<p>We can update the Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s firmware with <a href="https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update"><code>rpi-update</code></a>.
(Note that upgrading the firmware is not without risk.
Although <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration.html#raspberry-pi-3-and-4">the Jellyfin project does consider this important for hardware acceleration</a>, it is not absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, it will allow you to have the newest kernel and firmware updates available.
Proceed with caution.)</p>
<p><code>pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo apt install --yes rpi-update &amp;&amp; sudo rpi-update</code></p>
<p>You will be asked to confirm that you are comfortable with this upgrade.
If you are, enter <code>y</code>.
The firmware and kernel updates will now be applied.
You system is now on the absolute bleeding edge.</p>
<h3 id="i-keep-trying-to-reach-raspberrypilocal-but-it-just-will-not-resolve">I keep trying to reach raspberrypi.local, but it just will not resolve.</h3>
<p>So from my desktop, I will ping every currently used IP address on my local network to see what is in use with the program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap"><code>Nmap</code></a>, which I first need to install.</p>
<p><code>bcmryan@desktop:~$ sudo apt install --yes nmap</code></p>
<p>From there, I will have <code>Nmap</code> check which IP addresses are being used in my subnet.
I know from its inital setup that my router can be accessed at <code>192.168.0.1</code>, so since my Raspberry Pi and desktop are directly connected to my router, I know that both devices should have an IP address between <code>192.168.0.0</code> and <code>192.168.0.255</code> (a total of 256 addresses, which is definitely enough all the devices on my network).
The command used for this is pretty easy: <code>-sn</code> performs a ping scan, which means that the program is just seeing if the IP is in use (akin to ringing anyone&rsquo;s doorbell in an apartment building and seeing responds); <code>192.168.0.0-255</code> simply defines the range of all IP addresses to be scanned.</p>
<p><code>bcmryan@desktop:~$ nmap -sn 192.168.0.0-255</code></p>
<p>My result says that all addresses between 192.168.0.1 (my router) and 192.168.0.8 are in use (which are dynamic IP addresses, given on a first-come-first-served basis to whatever desktop, smartphone, tablet, smart device, etc. signed onto the network first), along with 192.168.0.20 and 192.168.0.25 (which are static IP addresses, something to which I will come shortly).</p>
<p>Since I do not know which IP address is used by the Raspberry Pi, I am just going to try to log in to each address via SSH with the default username and password until I find it.</p>
<p><code>bcmryan@desktop:~$ ssh pi@192.168.0.2</code></p>
<p>And it did not work.
That is not a problem.
Because just repeating the command (click the up arrow on your keyboard to get the most recent command) with a different last number on the IP address, I was able to find that the Raspberry Pi has the IP address 192.168.0.5.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-happy-with-just-using-samba-is-installing-jellyfin-absolutely-necessary">I am happy with just using Samba. Is installing Jellyfin absolutely necessary?</h3>
<p>This is your system.
You can do with it whatever you please.
I personally used a simple Samba share for at least a year before I saw the need to install Jellyfin.
Adding the nice GUI of Jellyfin increased the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor">appeal to my family members</a> who did not have the same urge to browse through directories to find backups of discs that we physically own (often causing them to just use the physical DVD or Blu-Ray instead of connecting to Samba at all) that I did.
Also the ability to create users and track what has been watched has been an absolute godsend.</p>
<p>But, I am also the first to admit that Jellyfin is not perfect.
ISO (i.e. an image of a full disc instead of ripped individual titles) playback is lacking to say the least (which is particularly interesting considering that Kodi and VLC, two other open-source projects, both play back the same files with no problems), and I honestly do not know if a file is transcoding correctly or not (or, for instance, if an uncompressed rip of a UHD Blu-Ray might just be too much to transcode on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB of RAM).
But to me, the pros outweigh the cons.
And since my media is available to me on my Samba share anyway, I can always just play any ISO file directly in VLC, and through the <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/clients/kodi.html#jellyfin-for-kodi">Kodi plugin</a>, I could also just it using that interface.
That is truly the power of open-source software.
It may not be perfect, but there are usually ways to make it do what you want if you put a bit of time into managing it.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, Jellyfin served two purposes: I wanted to exemplify how easy it is to set up a container with Docker Compose, and I personally wanted to document installing Jellyfin with hardware acceleration for future use.
If Jellyfin does not suit your needs, that is perfectly fine.
There are many <a href="https://perfectmediaserver.com/day-two/top10apps/">other great self-hosted applications for you to try</a>.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-graphical-way-to-set-system-settings">Is there a graphical way to set system settings?</h3>
<p>For changing settings like the hostname as in this example, you can use the powerful tool <code>raspi-config</code>.
As the program is pretty powerful, it requires <code>sudo</code> privileges.</p>
<p><code>pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo raspi-config</code></p>
<p>From here, make sure that the line <code>1 System Options</code> is highlighted, and hit enter.
Now hit the down arrow until <code>S4 Hostname</code> is highlighted, and again hit enter.
You will now be given a warning about valid characters in a hostname.
Make sure that yours complies.
Enter a valid hostname like <code>repi</code>.
Hit enter.
Type in your new hostname, and push the down arrow key so that <code>&lt;Ok&gt;</code> is highlighted, and hit enter.</p>
<p>Great.
The new hostname should now be set.
From here, you can choose to look at some other settings (such as locale and timezone in <code>5 Localisation Options</code>).
Here again, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md">the official documentation</a> is very extensive.
Once you are finished, select <code>&lt;Finish&gt;</code> with the right arrow key, and hit enter to exit.</p>
<h3 id="i-chose-the-exfat-file-system-so-that-my-drive-could-be-easily-read-by-windows-macos-and-linux-but-i-am-having-trouble-getting-it-to-properly-work">I chose the exFAT file system so that my drive could be easily read by Windows, macOS and Linux, but I am having trouble getting it to properly work.</h3>
<p>While the choice of exFAT as a file system makes sense for an external hard drive that is used with multiple operating systems, if the drive is being used in a file server with Samba, there will be no problem reading or writing to a file system like ext4, which has the benefit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_file_system">journaling</a>.
That said, if you would still like to use exFAT (as I did for many months before transitioning my files over the ext4), you will need to install <code>exfat-fuse</code> and <code>exfat-utils</code> (<code>sudo apt install --yes exfat-fuse exfat-utils</code>) and add an entry to <code>/etc/fstab</code> such as <code>UUID=1234-5678 /mnt/diskMovies1 exfat-fuse defaults,uid=200,gid=200 0 0</code>.
Note that UID and GID are defined here, as I personally have had issues with permissions with exFAT (an alternative would also be 1000 and 1000 for the current user and current group if problems still persist).</p>
