						<p>Once you have sucessfully set up and started using your new Raspberry Pi server, it is crucial that you keep your system up to date and keep your application data backed up.
Luckily, with the skills you have acquired or reinforced through this tutorial, you should be absolutely fine doing so.
Linux is an incredibly powerful base to the Rasbperry Pi OS explored in this tutorial, and its standard tools work very well for the maintaince of your system.</p>
<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>
<p>Backing up your data saved on your hard drives (i.e. everything in <code>/mnt/storage</code>) is of course important, and I subscribe to the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 backup strategy</a> of having the original file plus one copy locally and another copy in another location to restore any lost data if something catastrophic happens (if your house burns down a local backup will also be lost, but it is less likely that your backup at a family member&rsquo;s house will also be lost).
This section is concerned with backing up application data from Docker itself.
(As there are other scripts, configuration files and helpful explanations throughout this file, it might also not be a bad idea to create a local backup of this document as well for future reference.)
As everything unique to your setup is saved in <code>/docker</code>, this folder should be the main focus of your attention regarding the backing up of application data.</p>
<p>Before beginning with creating a backup, you need to create a folder with <code>mkdir</code> that is separate from your microSD card (if your microSD card were to have a problem, restoring a backup from it would not be possible).
For this folder location, use for instance <code>/mnt/diskMovies1/backup</code>.
This way you know exactly on which physical hard drive the backup is stored (creating <code>/mnt/storage/backup</code> might put it on any hard drive in that array).
Note that you need to use elevated privileges, as <code>/mnt/diskMovies1</code> is owned by user storagerw and group storage.
Note that this directory is owned by user root and group root and thus will require elevated privileges to access.
As backup files should generally not be modified, this seems sensible.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/diskMovies1/backup</code></p>
<p>For creating the backup, use <code>tar</code> with elevated privileges (as it will be saving a directory not owned by user pi to a folder not owned by user pi); options <code>--create</code> to create a new compressed file, <code>--gzip</code> to specify the compression format, <code>--file</code> to specify the save location of the new file (with the date appended to the file name using the <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/date.1.html"><code>date</code></a> command following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 standard</a> of year month day) and <code>--verbose</code> to list the files being processed; and finally the directory which is being compressed, i.e. <code>/docker</code>.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo tar --create --gzip --file /mnt/diskMovies1/backup/docker_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz --verbose /docker</code></p>
<p>To restore from the backup, again use the <code>tar</code> command with elevated privileges but this time with options <code>--extract</code>, <code>--gzip</code>, <code>--file</code> (with the location of backup file), <code>--verbose</code> and <code>--directory</code> to specify the extraction location of <code>/</code> (as the directory <code>docker</code> is at the base of the compressed file).</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo tar --extract --gzip --file /mnt/diskMovies1/backup/docker_2021-06-06.tar.gz --verbose --directory /</code></p>
<p>Note that following this restoration of your backup, you will need to adjust permissions of <code>/docker</code>.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p>Updating your system &ndash; along with keeping best practices in mind regarding the use of passwords and keys and the exposure of your system to the open internet &ndash; is a fundamental part of maintaining a secure system.
As any vulnerability in your system can be a gateway into your local network &ndash; and thus all other computers and smart devices in your home &ndash; it is absolutely imperative to run updates often in order to patch any security holes that may exist.</p>
<h3 id="apt">apt</h3>
<p>Using <code>apt</code>, downloading updates and installing upgrades is as simple as <code>sudo apt update --yes &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade --yes</code>.
This simple command will make sure that your computing experience remains safe and secure and almost never introduces insability in your system (although this is something that you will always need to keep an eye on).</p>
<h3 id="custom-scripts">Custom scripts</h3>
<p>As both Docker and Docker Compose were installed by executing a script downloaded from the internet and as Docker pulls new images from repositories defined in Docker Compose, updates to these will need to be run through a system separate from <code>apt</code>.
To keep these systems up to date, I have written a simple script that you should periodically run.
To save this script, again use <code>tee</code>.
You will notice that the file <code>dockerupdate</code> is being saved with elevated privileges to the directory <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>.
As this directory in your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH</a> (i.e. a list of directories with programs that can be executed without further specification), you will only need to enter <code>dockerupate</code> in your terminal emulator to run it.
The script functions as follows.
The script beging with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)"><code>shebang</code></a> (#!) and <code>/bin/bash</code> to define it as a Bash script.
You are first prompted that you will be updating Docker, Docker Compose and Docker images.
As this will immediately close these programs, you should not use this script while they are in use.
The script gives you 30 seconds to end the script (by entering Ctrl+C) via the <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man3/sleep.3.html"><code>sleep</code></a> command.
The <code>sleep</code> command is repeated throughout the script to make sure that each process has fully finished before beginning the next one.
The <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/tar.1.html"><code>tar</code></a> command creates a simple backup in a compressed file for restoring everything in <code>/docker</code> if needed later.
As Docker Compose can only be run via relative path, the script changes you to a parent directory, i.e. <code>/docker</code>.
Docker then stops all containers with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_stop/"><code>docker container stop</code></a> by listing them with <code>$(docker container ls --all --quiet)</code> and executing the stop command to all listed (i.e. all containers; <code>--quiet</code> lists only the container ID so that every stays understandable).
The newest <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose">Docker Compose image from LinuxServer.io</a> is again pulled, and all dangling images are pruned.
Docker Compose then pulls all images defined in Docker Compose config file and starts them in the background.
Finally, you are returned to your former working directory (since this was changed to <code>/docker</code> at the beginning of the script).
You will notice that before everything dollar sign (<code>$</code>) there is a backslash (<code>\</code>); this is Bash&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Escape-Character.html">escape character</a> and is used so that what literally follows is displayed (and thus while saving the script, the variables themselves are not used).</p>
<pre><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo tee /usr/local/bin/dockerupdate &lt;&lt; END
#! /bin/bash

echo &quot;This script will stop all Docker containers and update Docker, Docker Compose
and all Docker images. Cease the use of any Docker containers immediately. If you
would like to stop this script, you have 30 seconds to do so by entering Ctrl+C.&quot;

# sleep for 30 seconds
sleep 30s

# back up /docker
sudo tar --create --gzip --file /mnt/diskMovies1/backup/docker_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz --verbose /docker

# change directory because an update to Docker Compose can only be run via a relative path (https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3875#issuecomment-502899871)
cd /docker

# stop all Docker containers
docker container stop \$(docker container ls --all --quiet)

# sleep for 5 seconds
sleep 5s

# update Docker
curl https://get.docker.com | sh

# sleep for 5 seconds
sleep 5s

# update Docker Compose
docker pull linuxserver/docker-compose:&quot;\${DOCKER_COMPOSE_IMAGE_TAG:-latest}&quot;
docker image prune --force

# sleep for 5 seconds
sleep 5s

# update all images with Docker Compose
docker-compose --file ./docker-compose/docker-compose.yml pull

# sleep for 5 seconds
sleep 5s

# start all containers in background
docker-compose --file ./docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up --detach

# return to former working directory
cd &quot;\$OLDPWD&quot;
END
</code></pre><p>So that the script can be executed, change the mode to executable using <code>chmod +x</code>.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dockerupdate</code></p>
<p>Test this script with the newly created <code>dockerupdate</code> command.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ dockerupdate</code></p>
<p>To schedule automatic updates, you can employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a>, a time-based scheduler for running commands.
Using the correct formatting for cron, the job <code>* 4 * * 1 /usr/local/bin/dockerupdate &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code> is defined as the 04:00 (i.e. 4:00 AM) Monday execution of command <code>/usr/local/bin/dockerupdate</code> without logs (by sending all output to <code>/dev/null</code>).
While this is possible to input using <code>crontab -e</code>, I perfer to directly <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4880290/how-do-i-create-a-crontab-through-a-script">create a cron job with a single command</a>, thus making it easier for scripting.</p>
<p><code>pi@repi:~$ (crontab -l 2&gt;/dev/null; echo &quot;* 4 * * 1 /usr/local/bin/dockerupdate &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;) | crontab -</code></p>
<h2 id="nuking-and-paving">Nuking and paving</h2>
<p>After fully configuring your system, I highly recommend following the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/filesystem/backup.md">official documentation</a> and creating a backup image of your microSD card (with your drive letter changed and after unmounting your microSD card from your desktop along with your backup location).</p>
<p><code>bcmryan@desktop:~$ sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdd of=/path/to/backups/PiOS_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).img</code></p>
<p>Running this command in reverse flashes your microSD card.
(Again paying attention to the drive letter.)</p>
<p><code>bcmryan@desktop:~$ sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/backups/PiOS_2021-06-06.img of=/dev/sdd</code></p>
<p>That said, given the flexibility and relative ease of setting up a Raspberry Pi server, I genuinely think that the path of least resistence following a catastrophic failure in many cases is to simply rebuild your server and populate your Docker application data from the last local backup.
This rather drastic approach is called <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nuke_and_pave">nuking and paving</a>.
This approach allows you to reevaluate exactly what you are installing and why and may avoid problems if there were to have been bugs in earlier versions of software that was actually saved in the backup of the microSD card.
Since the applications themselves are not being backed up using the above method for Docker (i.e. creating a backup of <code>/docker</code>), this is generally not an issue with the application data of containers.</p>
