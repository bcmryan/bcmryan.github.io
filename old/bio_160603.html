		<h2>Student Experience Internship with International Academic Programs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison</h2>
	During the 2014-2015 academic year, I served as the Student Experience intern for Returning Students with International Academic Programs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In this role, I researched current study abroad methodology for handling students after they have spent a significant period of their college experience abroad through a university-organized study abroad or internship program.<a href="#" id="iap-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('iap');return false;"> [See more]</a>
      <div id="iap" class="more">
	<br>As a student who had both interned and studied abroad, I was particularly well-equipped to take the lead in this area. In this role, in addition to researching academic publications on study abroad, I communicated with study abroad offices at other universities, developed specific programing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison and advised study abroad professionals on preparing and handling culture- and safety-oriented situations before students leave campus, while abroad and upon return. Additionally, I updated documents and policies used by International Academic Programs and had a direct impact on the operation of student affairs in the office.<a href="#" id="iap-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('iap');return false;"> [See less]</a>

		<h2>Internship with the U.S. Department of State</h2>
    In the spring semester of 2013, I interned with the U.S. Department of State at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. In this role, I worked alongside diplomats and foreign dignitaries in matters of internal and external politics while focusing on the important role that Germany plays in world today. I gained experience through hosting international events, meeting with local and federal employees of the German government along with other American diplomats, and researching current events and the effects that German politics has on the world as a whole. During this 10-week period abroad, I also took part in the Worldwide Internship Program through the University of Wisconsin-Madison and completed necessary research and schoolwork which lead to earned university credit.<a href="#" id="state-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('state');return false;"> [See more]</a>
      <div id="state" class="more">
	<br>Professionally, I grew through more than only the use of German in the workplace. I experienced greater diversity than I ever thought imaginable and have earned the respect of colleagues through precision in my work and by insights and prospectives that I have had while studying short- and long-term trends in the German political world. Additionally, my personal motivation allowed me to take on projects normally completed by diplomats while exploring the functions of the U.S. Department of State's largest country mission and gaining a perspective of how a large organization operates.<br>
	<br>Individually, I learned the role of strict time commitments, executive functioning and published quality of work in the operation of an organization as large as the Department of State. Oftentimes, I personally represented the Embassy at official events and have reported back important developments of issues as the first link directly to the U.S. Government. Overall my time in Berlin led to an improvement of my communication skills to meet the level of precision and accuracy that has been required by this position as well as my exactness in translation.<br>
	<br>Interculturally, I also improved needed communication skills. Berlin, as a city of 3.5 million and an important cultural hub of Eastern and Western Europe, allowed me to work with people from every continent and many countries. My earned knowledge of differences and customs, not only of Germany as another Western nation, but also of the nations which influence it (specifically Turkey, the former Eastern bloc and Middle Eastern countries) has given me the experience I need to work in an ever-globalizing workplace. Beyond an improvement in linguistic skill, my cultural knowledge has allowed me to make decisions which impact communication in sometimes far greater ways.<br>
    <br>Specific projects that I worked on analyzed German electorate voting estimates for the September 2013 national elections. This project produced material which was sent to State Department employees around the world. Certain media reports that I analyzed had similar effects and I have been credited with work that has gone to Washington, D.C. My efforts have also brought interns from political parties to the U.S. Embassy in Berlin and allowed for an exchange with American interns to the German parliament. In social media, I have been hosted in official pictures on Facebook, attended a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry which was broadcasted via YouTube and scripted and helped with the filming of German language recruitment films. My intern experience influenced me personally, professionally and socially and has helped lead to my current goal of future diplomatic work while yielding direct results for the benefit of the U.S. Embassy and the field of foreign policy.<a href="#" id="state-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('state');return false;"> [See less]</a>

        <h2>Other Work Experience</h2>
    Before my internship in Berlin in spring 2013, I held various positions including Community Outreach Coordinator for WISPIRG Energy Service Corps with AmeriCorps in Madison, Wisconsin (summer 2012) and certified nurse aide (CNA) at the Richardton Health Center in Richardton, North Dakota (summer 2010) while mentoring at a youth camp near Jamestown, North Dakota (summer 2010). Previously, I also volunteered with and became president of an advisory at the Menomonie Public Library in Menomonie, Wisconsin (2007-2011). Beyond these experiences, I have also held positions including Desk Services member and general staff for University Housing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2011-2014).<br>
    <div id="wrap">
          <h2>Extracurricular Experience</h2>
    As an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I studied abroad for an academic year in Freiburg, Germany and actively participated in political discussions on campus with the Colloquium Politicum series while volunteering with disadvantaged students learning English at the Lernhaus Gutach in Gutach, Germany. Additionally, I hosted an international news radio show on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus radio station WSUM called 'Coup du Monde' and was an active participant of the German Club, Spanish 'Mesa de Conversaci&oacute;n' and the Electronic Music Production student organization.<a href="#" id="ecurric-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('ecurric');return false;"> [See more]</a>
      <div id="ecurric" class="more">
    <br> As a high school student at Menomonie High School, I additionally attended two Junior State of America summer schools (at Princeton and Stanford Universities) where I was awarded as a best speaker, was elected as a local government official at the 2010 Badger Boys' State camp, have been a state-awarded speaker in Forensics and held the duties of officer in numerous other organizations.<br>
    <br>Naturally, these experiences have given me more than the ever-important resume-building honor, but have allowed me to work with -- and serve -- the young, the old, the sick, students, educators, community members, Americans working and serving abroad, and the uninformed. I do not intend to have this service end when I become a professional, but rather wish to meld passion and education into a career where I love what I do while making the world a better place for future generations.<a href="#" id="ecurric-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('ecurric');return false;"> [See less]</a>

		  <p><h2>Personal Narrative: Sprachenlust</h2>
    My love for language began when I was a child. As someone who had plans to conquer the world before the age of 10, I knew that effective communication would be paramount to spreading my armies around the globe.<a href="#" id="narrative-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('narrative');return false;"> [See more]</a>
      <div id="narrative" class="more">
    <br>Of course, with age and the realization that this goal was one that was great to have, yet probably unfeasible, I began to study language in a different way. I thought about the creation of an impossibly simple language that would seem almost intuitive to anyone who would learn it with an alphabet made of only sounds. Yet the boyish instinct in me had a role to play as in the back of my mind I always thought that this language (named Colanish and later Basic -- not to be confused with the computer language BASIC or the language of Galactic Basic Standard from <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Wars</span>, ahem, English) would aid in my unification of the Earth under the banner of the United Provinces of Pacifia (also Atlantia) Coland (nations of my own invention). Much to my chagrin, I did not create this great union but I soon found these pursuits of language simplification well underway through the efforts of artificial languages such as Esperanto and alphabets like the International Phonetic Alphabet.<br>
    <br>So, I changed my life course from emperor to polyglot and set out to learn the basics of language (which I soon found to be named linguistics) and try my hand at a few languages that were taught in my school district (Japanese, German, Spanish and French). I began with Japanese and German in middle schoolout of availability and continued with German (Japanese was cut from our curriculum) while beginning Spanish (10th grade) and French (12th) in high school. I graduated with the honor of Menomonie High School's Foreign Language Award and the President's Education Award as a National Honor's Society member when I decided to pursue linguistics at the Universityof Wisconsin-Madison.<br>
    <br>At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, my love for language was not dimmed but enhanced. I found Yucatec Maya accidently during orientation and decided enroll in it while also continuing with German, Spanish and French. Due to the excellent teaching staff of the Department of German, I knew that a double-major was a necessity. Furthermore, while a student in Freiburg, Germany, I also found myself enrolled in Turkish as I came to understand the special role that the culture and language plays in modern Europe. As I have matured, so have my ambitions with language -- I hope that my days of masterminding and scheming are behind me so I that I may effectively use my skills for good, not evil. So, while the world does not <span style="font-style:italic;">yet</span> fly under the flag of Coland, I understand the need for dedicated linguists today more than ever.<br>
    <br>With one language disappearing every 14 days (source: National Geographic Enduring Voices Project), the need to preserve language is here. At this rate, by the time of my 107th birthday (I intend to live this long with the assistance of my future robotic body), nearly half of the world's 7000 languages will be lost. I feel a personal need to help the documentation and overall survival of language and their dialects.<br>
    <br>To me, language has been an important focus throughout my life and I am truly starting to understand how it can affect everything all the time. It is something that is truly amazing and I know that it will be indispensable in my future life and employment.<a href="#" id="narrative-hide" class="hideLink" onclick="showHide('narrative');return false;"> [See less]</a>
